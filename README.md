# My Portfolio
## Description
- The goal of this project was to develop a working mini quiz that can be used by any and all to stress themselves out while learning.
- Utilizing a well made quiz can help anyone make sure they are learning and retaining information via trial and error.
- Creating this mini quiz has again increased my working knowledge regarding the possibilities available to me using Javascript.

## Usage
- When enterering the application, simply click the button, then follow the multiple choice questions to run through the quiz. Remember there will be time added or subtracted depending on whether you get the questions right or wrong.
